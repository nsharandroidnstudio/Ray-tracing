Ray Tracing in Python
This project is a simple implementation of a Ray Tracer in Python. Ray Tracing is a technique for rendering images by simulating the way light interacts with objects in a scene to produce realistic lighting and shadows.

Features
Basic ray tracing algorithm
Rendering of spheres and planes
Diffuse and specular reflection
Simple lighting model with ambient, diffuse, and specular components
